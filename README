  dotfiles -- manage your dotfiles in git

This file should reside as .dotfiles.sh somewhere (in /root or some
trusted users home).  That makes it possible to revision itself. An
user can then install a symlink from a directory in PATH to this file
to make it accessible for execution.

After that the 'init' command sets up '~/.dotfiles' as bare git
repository where configuration files will be stored. There will be no
'master' branch but a "$USER@$HOSTNAME" branch. This makes it
possible to manage dotfiles from different users/hosts in a single
repository and checkout/merge specific parts without affecting the
configuration of other installations.

If existing the '~/.dotfilesrc' file can be used to customize certain
aspects (see CONFIGURATION below).

dotfiles is a very thin layer over 'git' it adds a few commands for
convinience but otherwise all normal git commands are available.

COMMANDS

  install
     install a 'dotfiles' symlink to this script in $2 or /usr/local/bin

  init
     initialize the '~/.dotfiles' repository

  help
     show this help

  autocommit
     do an automatic commit saving all pending changes (for cron)

  store
     add and commit files in one go (any non-file argument becomes the commit message)

  upgrade
     upgrade dotfiles itself

CONFIGURATION

  The user can configure variables in '~/.dotfilesrc'. When this file
  does not exist or variables are not defined, defaults apply.

  DOTFILES_DIR="$HOME/.dotfiles"
    The directory where 'dotfiles' will create the local repository

  DOTFILES_BRANCH="$(whoami)@$(hostname)"
    Git branch name for local commits.

  DOTFILES_HOME="$HOME"
    The toplevel directory to be tracked.

  DOTFILES_PUSH
    A list of remotes where to push automatically after storing changes.

  DOTFILES_UPGRADE
    remote/branch specification from where to update 'dotfiles' itself

EXAMPLES SETUP

  install as /usr/local/bin/dotfiles
    sh ~/.dotfiles.sh install

  initialize dotfiles once before use
    dotfiles init

  register a daily autocommit in the users crontab
    (crontab -l ; echo "@daily dotfiles autocommit" ) | crontab


  use 'git-crypt' for encrypting secret files

  initialize git-crypt
    dotfiles crypt init

  add your own gpg key for decryption
    dotfiles crypt add-gpg-user $(git config --get user.email)

  set up .gitattributes for files to be encrypted
    echo ".ssh/** filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt" >>.gitattributes
    echo ".ssh/**/*.pub !filter !diff" >>.gitattributes
    echo ".gnupg/** filter=git-crypt diff=git-crypt" >>.gitattributes
    dotfiles store .gitattributes

  Confirm git-crypot is working
    dotfiles check-attr -a -- .ssh/*


EXAMPLES USAGE

  Add and commit changes in '.fileA' and 'FileB' with "commit
  message". Any non-file argument to 'store' is appended as to the
  commit message.
    dotfiles store .fileA FileB "commit message"

  list all files under dotfiles control
    dotfiles ls-files

  show git status/changes
    dotfiles status
    dotfiles diff

EXAMPLE UPGRADE FROM UPSTREAM

  Updates dotfiles from the upstream/orignal repository
    dotfiles remote add upstream git://git.pipapo.org/dotfiles
    echo 'DOTFILES_UPGRADE="upstream/master"' >>.dotfilesrc
    dotfiles upgrade
